The Keras framework was utilized to implement the neural network models for these projects.

MLP_Regression and MLP_Classification Projects:

These files contain the implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron for regression and classification problems respectively.
In the classification problem, regularization was also added to compare the results with and without it.


VGG Project:

We used the VGG19 model for transfer learning in the VGG file, and we also attempted to improve our results by implementing data augmentation and fine-tuning.


CNN Project:

A convolutional neural network was utilized in the CNN file, and we applied data augmentation to enhance our results.
